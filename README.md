# Prediction of Survival of Titanic Passenger

Here we'll use Logistic Regression to predict the survival rate of passenger.

Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. 

The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.

We have titanic dataset that contains,
- pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
- survival: A Boolean indicating whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No; 1 = Yes); this is our target
- name: A field rich in information as it contains title and family names
- sex: male/female
- age: Age, asignificant portion of values aremissing
- sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- ticket: Ticket number.
- fare: Passenger fare (British Pound).
- cabin: Doesthe location of the cabin influence chances of survival?
- embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
